I expect to learn a lot on how to use Git and Github so I can collaborate seamlessly with my team. 
I hope that the HTML and CSS concepts that I learned will be refreshed in this course. I hope that
I will learn more with regards to Web Programming in general, understand its key concepts and will be 
able to create a web apllication in the future.
